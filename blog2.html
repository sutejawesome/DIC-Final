            <p class="date_blog1">Date: 04 June, 2022</p>
            <img class="blog1_img" src="blog2.jpg" alt="" width="780px">
            <p class="para_blog1">Climate change impacts the very fabric of our everyday lives, and the responsibility lies with us to protect our planet. At the Flipkart Group, we take that responsibility with the urgency it deserves.</p>
            <p class="para_blog1">Apparel for All Group has committed to setting an ambitious Net Zero target accross its value chain by 2040, becoming the only Indian e-commerce company in India to commit to this environmental goal. To ‘go net zero’ is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or to ensure that any ongoing emissions are balanced by removals.</p>
            <p class="para_blog1">As part of this commitment, the Apparel for All Group will take measures in its own operations to
reduce 100% of emissions by 2030 by increasing energy efficiency at its corporate office, supply
chain facilities, and powering its energy requirements through renewable sources such as solar.
Recognising that the majority of the climate impact comes from Apparel for All’s extended value chain
of suppliers, waste in operations, transportation and logistics, and product end-of-life, it will also work with its sellers, consumers, and partners to achieve Net Zero emissions by 2040.</p>
            <p class="para_blog1">“We are proud to announce our commitment to Net Zero emissions by 2040,”, Chief Executive Officer, Apparel for All Group, said at the launch of the initiative. “This commitment is a significant undertaking in our journey towards building a sustainable business, and we want to play our part in adopting a proactive approach to create shared value across the ecosystem. As part of our Net Zero efforts, our sustainability initiatives will include the larger
            ecosystem, comprising our sellers, customers, and brands, to bring about an industry-wide shift. We recognise the importance of working collaboratively to reduce climate impact and will continue to steer our efforts towards this commitment and to decarbonise the e-commerce value chain.”</p>
             <p class="para_blog1">The Flipkart Group will focus on the following key areas of impact to achieve a clearly defined decarbonisation pathway:
    <ul style="background-color: #F4EEFF; color: #424874; font-size: 20px ">
    <li>  Sustainable Platform: Drive consumer awareness and initiatives to support sustainable
      products while creating circular business models.</li>
      <li>
          Responsible Value Chain: Through electrification of logistics, incorporating renewable
          energy, environment-friendly packaging, waste management initiatives, and responsible
          sourcing in business practices, the establishment of green infrastructure, and supplier
          engagement and seller education.</li>
          <li>Impact Positive Collaborations: Fostering industry partnerships to develop innovative
          solutions for creating a sustainable e-commerce model.</li>
